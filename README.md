# Bella Otér – Mini Product Discovery Page 

This is a submission for the Bella Otér Software Intern Short Test. It’s a responsive, mobile-first product discovery page simulating the beginning of the Raven Body Profile experience.


## ✨ Overview

The page presents the user with a soft, elegant question:  
> “What does your body crave today?”

Upon selecting one of four options — **Grounding**, **Softness**, **Energy**, or **Freedom** — the page transitions to a personalized archetype result, showcasing a matching product, description, and fabric tag. Users can return to the question anytime with a “Start Over” button.

If the user has visited before, the app welcomes them back and restores their last selection (thanks to `localStorage`).


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **LocalStorage** for session memory
- **Custom SVG** icon for Bella Otér brand tone

## 🔍 Features

- 🌿 Mobile-first responsive layout
- 🧘 Elegant typography and neutral, pastel tones
- 🧠 Custom archetype logic
- 💾 LocalStorage persistence with “Welcome Back” message
- ♻️ Clean state reset with “Start Over” button
- 🖼️ Dynamic product preview with placeholder image block

## ⏱️ Time Spent
2hours 45minutes

## What’s Working:
- Fully functional logic from question to personalized product result
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Visuals and tone align with Bella Otér’s brand aesthetics
- Custom SVG icon and smooth UX transitions
- Bonus feature: saved selection + welcome back message

## 🚀 What I’d Add with More Time 
- Introduce a lightweight animation or visual transition when switching between question and product views
- Use actual product images or themed illustrations instead of placeholders for visual richness
- Add more detailed archetype data, such as mood, style, or additional tags
- Implement a soft intro screen or loader to enhance brand storytelling
- Optionally break up the product section into a multi-step quiz experience for added depth
